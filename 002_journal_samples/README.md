Lists contain the journals (and their Scopus IDs) that we look at.

Each selected journal is of one 30 journals drawn at random from each of the top four octiles of journals according to the Scimago Journal Impact Factor in late 2018.  That is, we divide the journal rankings into octiles.  Then, for the top four octiles, we sample 30 journals at random.
